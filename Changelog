- Fix formatting bug (maxes not being cleared on each round)

2.2.0

- Add support for deleting states ('x' key)
- Move navigation help to top of interactive help so people can learn how
  to navigate without having to navigate to the bottom of the help
- When --lookup is enabled, resolve port names as well ast hostnames
  (reported by Viliam Holub <holub@nenya.ms.mff.cuni.cz>)
- Display the ICMP ID on ICMP states
- Fix scrolling bug if totals or filters were enabled
- General improvement of all scrolling calculations
- Add 'B' as a way to sort by previous columbn (opposite of 'b')
- Add ^d for pagedown and ^u for pageup

2.1
- Released 10/05/06
- Fixed bug where -s was doing what -S should do and -d was doing
  what -D should do. Thanks to Brian Nelson for catching this.

2.0
- Released 10/04/06
- Moved man page to section 8

  (reported by Bill Hudacek <hudaceks@verizon.net>)

- Add display of skipped entries on "totals" line
- Move various char*'s to strings.
- Move most snprintf()s to stringstreams.
- Rewrite and significantly improve dynamic sizing of columns
- Add a new interactive help window
- Add srcpt and dstpt filtering
- Add long options
- Make interactive help scroll-able
- Make main window scroll-able
- Make having the main window be scrollable configurable and if not scrollable
  then use stdscr instead of a pad. Make this togglable interactively.
- Redo command-line options so they match interactive options
- Add ability to change all filters and the refresh rate interactively
- Handle window resizes (SIGWINCH) properly
- If we can't read ip_conntrack, error and exit rather than fail
  silently

- Add color-coding of protocols

1.3
- Released 05/27/03
- Steve Augart finally proved the 'memory leak' was in
  ncurses as I'd always suspected but was unable to prove
  Thanks Steve!
- Increased snprintf boundaries in printline function to
  ensure newlines don't get cut off (Thanks to Todd Lyons)
- Added dynamic sizing of iptstate based on term info.
- Updated Makefile to only recompile if needed
- Fixed gethostbyaddr() call to compile on more systems
- Fixed truncation bug that ocassionally truncated one char
  too few
- Added NOTES section to man page, plus other docs on new
  features
- Fixed some man page bugs

1.2.1
- Released 07/01/02
- Fixes for GCC3
  - cast 'x' in 'log' so GCC knows which log I mean
  - add -Wno-deprecated to Makefile
- Fix small bug in manpage that made -R not show up
- Fix crash if protocol is not found in /etc/protocols
- Update 'uninstall' in Makefile

1.2.0
- Released 04/20/02
- Various doc updates
- Lots of code cleanups
- Added documentation for interactive-mode options
- Added interactive-mode toggles for -f -t -l
- Added option to display totals
- Added filtering of loopback
- Added sorting by hostname
- Added DNS hostname lookups
- Improved SrcIP and DstIP sorting
- Added sorting by port

1.1.0
- Released 03/30/02
- Will now read in all connections instead of just 50
   For single-line use, it will display them all as well.
- Added command line flag for reverse sorting
- Cleaned up reading of options
- Fixed sorting of TTL/ cleaned up sorting code
- Fixed uninstall in Makfile

1.0.1
- Released 02/27/02
- Added spec file so people can build RPMs if the like
- Fix 'timeval' compile error for certain platforms.
	Bizzare bug, I'm guessing in GCC. On some platforms
	it wants to use sys/time.h. It will fail if you use 
	sys/select.h or time.h. Go figure.
- Take out src port and dst port for non tcp,udp cases
- Give 'rate' an initial value
- Fixed Big Endian Problem with command line arguments
- Fixed Makefile (put LIBS at end)
- Change "proto" field to look up by protocol number field of
	ip_conntrack instead of take it from the name field.
        This should now support pretty much any protocol. I 
	was unaware that ip_conntrack printed 'unknown' for 
	protos other than tcp, udp, and icmp.
